By using Athena to query data from the Raw Bucket and storing the querying data in another Bucket.

Step 1: Create an S3 Raw Bucket1, and add the Raw Data to it
              Create an S3 querying data Bucket2, when we query from Athena, that data will be available here.

Step 2: Create Amazon Athena
        -> Go with Trino SQL (It will immediately launch)
        -> Query Edit Settings - Browse/provide querying data Bucket2

        -> Table & Views - Create source from S3 Bucket data
            -> Provide table name, create/provide database name, 
                Provide input/source bucket, provide appropriate file format, and Provide Column details based on the Raw document
       -> Create Table.

We have set up the data. So, we can query the data based on a request/wish from the Raw Document.

E.g.. Queries:
Select * from tablename limit 30;
Select count(*) from tablename;


***THE END***
